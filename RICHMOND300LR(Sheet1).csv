,"Purpose of the master plan: The Master Plan is an important document because it provides a framework for the City, the development community, business owners, and residents to shape the growth of Richmond. This Master Plan also sets the guidance to initiate and evaluate policies, programs, and zoning changes, and to guide the City’s capital improvement plan. Richmond is 62.5 square miles and is not allowed to annex land. The Master Plan helps determine how to plan for growth within the constrained footprint of the city. Furthermore, every jurisdiction in Virginia is required to prepare a master plan (also known as the comprehensive plan) per the Code of Virginia (§ 15.2- 2223) and review it every 5 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
